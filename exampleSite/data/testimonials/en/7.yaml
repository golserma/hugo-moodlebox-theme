text: "The MoodleBox is awesome. I used it today for the first time in a workshop and it worked perfectly. Until now we printed out all the papers and couldn’t really use videos. I simply copied all the videos into the Moodle courses and now people can use their smartphone to watch the videos, which is just perfect."
